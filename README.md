A JupyterLab extension for version control using Git

![](http://g.recordit.co/N9Ikzbyk8P.gif)

To see the extension in action, open the example notebook included in the Binder [demo](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git/master?urlpath=lab/tree/examples/demo.ipynb).

## Prerequisites

- JupyterLab
- Git (version `>=1.7.0`)

## Usage

- Open the Git extension from the _Git_ tab on the left panel

## Install

To install perform the following steps:

```bash
pip install --upgrade jupyterlab-git
jupyter lab build
```

### Troubleshooting

Before consulting the following list, be sure the server extension and the frontend extension have the same version by executing the following commands:

```bash
jupyter serverextension list
jupyter labextension list
```

- **Issue**: the Git panel does not recognize that you are in a Git repository.

  Possible fixes:

  - Be sure to be in a Git repository in the filebrowser tab

  - Check the server log. If you see a warning with a 404 code similar to:  
    `[W 00:27:41.800 LabApp] 404 GET /git/server_root?1576081660665`

    Explicitly enable the server extension by running:

    ```bash
    jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_git
    ```

  - If you are using JupyterHub or some other technologies requiring an initialization script which includes the jupyterlab-git extension, be sure to install both the frontend and the server extension **before** launching JupyterLab.

- **Issue**: the Git panel is not visible.

  Possible fixes:

  - Check that the JupyterLab extension is installed:

    ```bash
    jupyter labextension list
    ```

    If you don't see `@jupyterlab/git v... enabled OK` in the list, explicitly install the jupyter labextension by running:

    ```bash
    jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/git
    ```

### Install

Requires node 4+ and npm 4+

```bash
# Install new-ish JupyterLab
pip install -U jupyterlab

# Clone the repo to your local environment
git clone https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git.git
cd jupyterlab-git

# Install the server extension in development mode and enable it
pip install -e .[test]
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_git

# Build the labextension and dev-mode link it to jlab
jlpm build
jupyter labextension link .
```

To rebuild the package after a change and the JupyterLab app:

```bash
jlpm run build
jupyter lab build
```

Or start jupyter in watch mode:
```bash
jupyter lab --watch
```
And in a separate session, start this project in watch mode:
```bash
jlpm run watch
```
Now every change will be built locally then bundled into Jupyter Lab. Refresh the page after any save to see your change (note: you'll need to wait for webpack to finish, which can take 10s+ at times).

To execute the tests

```bash
pytest jupyterlab_git
jlpm run test
```
